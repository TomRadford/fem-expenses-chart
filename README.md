## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

I got to implement SASS in a project for the first time while also learning some new CSS grid tricks.


### Continued development

I found the SASS workflow within a react project a little clunky - especially in terms of not being able to allow components to be self-contained if I had to break the project down into the atomic structure (their styling would exist in seperate SCSS's). In future, I want to tro use something like styled-components or tailwind for a more component-centric approach.
